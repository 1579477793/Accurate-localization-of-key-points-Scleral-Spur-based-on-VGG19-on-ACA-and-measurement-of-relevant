# Accurate-localization-of-key-points-Scleral-Spur-based-on-VGG19-on-ACA-and-measurement-of-relevant
In previous studies, classification tasks were completed, and the ACA was divided into three categories: open, closed, and narrow. However, it is important to locate the scleral-spur of open angle and narrow angle  and measure the relevant parameters.  
在之前的研究中，完成了分类任务，并将ACA分为三类：开、闭和窄三类。然而，对开角和窄角的巩膜突的定位及相关参数的测量是非常重要的。
save_data.py 是对原始图像进行处理的程序，图像转换为.npy形式。  
数据一共有四个：  
训练集：图像x_train.npy, 标签y_train.npy  
测试集：图像x_test.npy, 标签y_test.npy
