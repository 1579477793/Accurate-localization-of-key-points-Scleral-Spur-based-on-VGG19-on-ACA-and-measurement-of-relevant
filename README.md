In previous studies, classification tasks were completed, and the ACA was divided into three categories: open, closed, and narrow. However, it is important to locate the scleral-spur of open angle and narrow angle  and measure the relevant parameters.  
在之前的研究中，完成了分类任务，并将ACA分为三类：开、闭和窄三类。然而，对开角和窄角的巩膜突的定位及相关参数的测量是非常重要的。
